                        The project is about software architecture of the PayWave
                        system in the Safe-To-Pay application. It specifies the system structure and design of 
                        several modules which have been discussed in the Software Requirement Specification 
                        (SRS) document in graphical way. Diagrams such as use case diagram, data flow diagram, 
                        activity diagram and sequence diagram will be provided in this document to have better 
                        understanding on the way such as how the customers’ data will be stored and how the data 
                        exchange happens in the application to implement the module by the project team. 
                        The goal of the project is to ensure that the payWave system in the application can be 
                        developed in a significant way as the customer can fully utilize the PayWave system in a 
                        more convenient way. Throughout this project, developers can have a proper reference to 
                        develop this application based on this document. As we know that nowadays the paywave system is less secure which is everyone that holds that card can easily wave that card . Therefore, our mini project is about to give some enhancement for that paywave system so that it will be secure for card holder/owner . This will add some features like adding dependent like family information so that they can use that card.</p>

It underscores the increasing computerization of human lifestyles, especially in the realm of healthcare, with clinics and hospitals continuously adopting and upgrading electronic devices and technologies for improved diagnosis and treatment. This project emphasizes the integration of smart wearable devices like health-tracking smartwatches, which enable individuals to monitor their health metrics such as heart rate and calories. The data collected can be seamlessly transferred to mobile devices for real-time health monitoring. Specifically, the Huawei Health App is introduced as a robust mobile application that offers a wide range of health tracking features, including GPS-based location tracking, goal setting for daily activities, and essential health measurements like heart rate, calories, oxygen levels (SpO2), and Body Mass Index (BMI) calculations. The application's user-friendly layout and ease of use are highlighted as key strengths, ensuring that users can efficiently utilize it for health monitoring within a short timeframe, aligning with the objectives of the Software Validation and Verification course.</p>

                        is tailored to address the limitations of the traditional paper-based approach, such as inefficiencies in data handling and the challenges of maintaining consistent records due to changes in librarian shifts. By integrating functionalities
                        for adding, updating, deleting, and reporting book and borrower data, the system significantly eases the administrative burden on library staff. It not only streamlines the process of managing books and borrower interactions but
                        also ensures secure and reliable data storage. This transition to a user-friendly online interface greatly enhances the overall library experience for both staff and users, demonstrating a significant advancement in library management
                        practices. The project is a testament to leveraging technology for improving organizational efficiency and user accessibility in a library setting.</p>

For the consumer-side front-end, the webpage design incorporates various languages such as Thymeleaf, Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), and Cascading Style Sheet (CSS).

The primary purpose of this web service is to manage examination attendance. It records student attendance and provides reports to the invigilator and lecturer regarding the student's status. The attendance can be recorded using four different input methods: self-check-in, QR code, matriculation number, and fingerprint.

To build the web service, we have implemented various methods such as GET, POST, DELETE, and PUT. Additionally, we have tested the API using the POSTMAN software.</p>

                    <p class="about__text ">The "Car Rental System" project exemplifies the application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles using Java. It showcases the development of a robust system to manage car rentals, utilizing Java's OOP features like classes,
                        inheritance, and polymorphism. The system connects to a local MySQL database, implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for efficient data handling. This project demonstrates the practical use of Java in developing
                        a user-friendly interface and a backend that securely manages car rental data, offering an interactive and streamlined car rental experience.</p>

This entails creating isolated environments where virtual machines (VMs) can interact using static IP addresses. Additionally, I demonstrate my ability to deploy various servers, including web, FTP, and media servers, within these private networks. This setup enables secure testing and development environments, ensuring that applications and services can be developed and tested effectively while maintaining network isolation.</p>

The core objective of this project is to translate data structure concepts into practical coding implementation to develop a functional car rental system. While it may be considered a relatively straightforward project, it holds significant educational value as it underscores the application of data structure principles in a real-world context. By creating a system that facilitates the rental and management of cars, this project allows students to gain hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of data structures within the context of car rental operations, enhancing their skills in software development and data structure utilization. </p>

                        The "Procrastination during MCO" project is a creative exploration into the common yet often unaddressed issue of procrastination, especially heightened during the Movement Control Order (MCO). This animation project, crafted using Adobe Illustrator,
                        demonstrates the fusion of art and storytelling to convey a compelling narrative. Adobe Illustrator's robust features were utilized to design captivating visuals and characters, bringing to life the subtle nuances of procrastination
                        in a relatable and engaging manner. The project highlights the challenges and humorous aspects of staying productive during extended periods at home, offering viewers both entertainment and reflection on their personal experiences
                        during the MCO.

                        During the COVID-19 pandemic, I initiated an online seafood business, offering a variety of seafood options, and facilitated customer orders when access to physical fish markets was restricted. I effectively promoted my products through Facebook groups, and this venture served as a side job, primarily during my semester breaks. I handled various aspects of the business, including customer service and delivery as a runner. 
                        Furthermore, I've expanded and scaled my entrepreneurial efforts since then. Presently, I am the owner of Hafiz Seafood Supplier Sdn Bhd, a seafood supply business that caters to local restaurants in my area and also serves individuals through online platforms. This growth has allowed me to contribute to the seafood industry in a more substantial way while continuing to adapt and thrive in challenging circumstances.
